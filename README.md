# Export-Assets-Coordinates---Photoshop-script-es
This is useful when you need to generate locations for assetName.png and don't want to manually measure each location.

Installation

Place script in:
Mac: '~/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS#/Presets/Scripts/'
Win: 'C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS#\Presets\Scripts'
Restart Photoshop

Use
In a PSD:

Open PSD file > Choose File > Scripts > Export Assets Coordinates

Data can be copied or saved as txt file on Desktop.

Notes
X and Y coordinates are taken from the top left of the document.
The script reads the top left bounds of every layer, so be prepared to adjust for offset if you need measurements exact down to the pixel.
